# Cross-compile FFmpeg for Android (arm64-v8a) using the Android NDK.
#
# Runs from a POSIX shell (Git for Windows / MSYS2) on a plain Windows box --
# no WSL, no Docker, no MSYS2 required. Everything the build needs is already
# on the machine:
#
#   * POSIX shell + awk/sed/grep/perl/tar  -> Git for Windows (sh.exe)
#   * GNU make 4.3                          -> $NDK/prebuilt/windows-x86_64/bin/make.exe
#   * clang for aarch64-android             -> $LLVM/bin/aarch64-linux-android<API>-clang
#                                              (the extension-less bash wrapper -- the .cmd
#                                               variant cannot be exec'd from a POSIX shell)
#   * nasm/yasm                             -> only needed for x86 targets, not used here
#
# Usage (from PowerShell):
#   sh scripts/build_ffmpeg_android.sh
#
# Env overrides:
#   ANDROID_API      API level to compile against (default 26; AAudio needs 26+)
#   FFMPEG_SRC       FFmpeg source tree (default D:/Devs/tmp/ffmpeg-7.1.1)
#   FFMPEG_PREFIX    install prefix          (default <repo>/third_party/ffmpeg-android/arm64)
#   JOBS             parallel make jobs      (default: nproc)

# "libavfilter/vf_qp.o" is the giveaway) and llvm-ar reports the truncated tail
# as missing files.
#
# Wrapping `ar` in a script does NOT help -- the wrapper's own argv is already

# through a command line at all, so library.mak's archive rule is patched below
# to route it through an @file response file (LLVM ar has supported @file since
# LLVM 12). `$(file >...)` is evaluated by make itself, so the list never

# Static libs only: they get linked straight into libraptor_ffi.so, so the APK
# ships a single .so instead of six libav*.so files.
#
# --enable-pic is mandatory: the objects end up inside a shared object.
# Every tool is passed explicitly: FFmpeg 7.x's configure has no bare `clang`/`gcc`
# case in its --toolchain switch (only `clang-*` sanitizer variants, msvc, gcov, ...),
# `--toolchain=llvm` only exists from FFmpeg 8 on, and the NDK dropped GNU binutils
# back in r23 -- so the llvm binutils have to be named one by one.
# --disable-autodetect keeps the dependency set at "libc only" (no zlib, no iconv,
#   no TLS stack), which keeps the static link from dragging in more system libs.
# --disable-encoders: raptor only demuxes and decodes (no encoder is referenced
#   anywhere in crates/), and dropping the encoders removes a large chunk of
#   libavcodec -- including the native Opus encoder that Android cannot load.

# `$(file >f,$^)` is expanded by make (never by a shell), and `$^` is make's own
# authoritative prerequisite list -- which is exactly what must not be guessed at
# by hand: FFmpeg 7.x spreads codec sources over subdirectories
# (libavcodec/aarch64/, libavcodec/opus/, libavcodec/hevc/, libavutil/aarch64/,
# ...), and a glob of the top level silently leaves ~10% of the objects out of
# the archive.
